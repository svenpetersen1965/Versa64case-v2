# Versa64case-v2
The Versa64case v2 is my 2nd approach to a 3D printed case for the <a href="https://github.com/bwack/Versa64Cart">Versa64card by bwack</a>. 

The goal was to develope a case, that is less complicated than the first case from 2019 and only consist of two parts while offering fill access to the DIP-switch and the configuration jumpers. Also, a closed version without this access is required, in case no configuration change is desired or for the <a href="https://github.com/svenpetersen1965/Epyx-FastLoad">Epxy Fast Load cartridge</a>.

# Versions

1. <b>Versa64case With Full Configuration Access</b><br>
This version allows to access the DIP-switch and the configuration jumpers.

2. <b>Versa64case Without Configuration Access</b><br>
This version does not allow changing the configuration of the Versa64cart without opening the case, which might be a desirable option for some projects.
